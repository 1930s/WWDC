##Contributing to the unofficial WWDC app for macOS project

Thanks for your interest in contributing to the project. Please make sure you follow the guidelines to maximize the chances of your contribution being accepted.

##1. Issues

Here are the main reasons you might want to open an issue:

####I. Bugs

When the app behaves in an unexpected way or simply breaks, please file a bug report and describe what you were doing when the problem occurred, what was the expected result and what was the actual result.

Remember to include the version of the operating system you're running and the type/model of the machine (MacBook Mid 2009, iMac Late 2012, etc).

####II. Crashes

If you get a crash please open an issue and explain what you were trying to do when the crash happened, include a video or screenshots of the problem if possible.

Remember to include the version of the operating system you're running and the type/model of the machine (MacBook Mid 2009, iMac Late 2012, etc).

####III. Feature Requests

If you want a new feature to be implemented, you can open an issue explaining why the feature would be useful to you and to other people.

Keep in mind that we try to keep the app focused and exotic features or features which would add too much complexity to the code may be rejected.

#### Issue template

Please follow the issue template provided when opening your issue, especially if it's a bug report.

##2. Code (Pull Requests)

**Important: pull requests that only contain refactoring of existing code without fixing any bugs, improving performance or implementing a new feature will not be accepted.**

####I. Tip: Ask before you code

It has happened a couple of times that we were working on a feature and someone opened a pull request implementing that same feature. This wastes time and effort because only one of the solutions will actually be used, so before you start coding I suggest you take a look at the open issues to see what's being worked on at the moment. If an issue already has someone assigned to it, don't start working on an implementation. It's also important to open an issue before working on a new feature if it's not already listed, because not every feature fits our vision of the app and we like to review feature ideas before implementing them.

If you see an open issue and you want to fix it, reply to the issue announcing that you're going to work on it so other people know there's someone already working on that.

####II. Use Swift

All new code in the app should be written in Swift using the latest stable version of Xcode.

####III. Use spaces instead of tabs

Do not start a war over this, I don't even have an opinion about this, I just use spaces because I contributed to some project once and people told me I had to use spaces, so I changed the setting in Xcode and never thought about it again, I have much more important stuff to worry about ðŸ™„

Here's how my Xcode indentation preferences are, please use the same settings when working on this project:

####IV. Use `guard` and `return` early whenever possible

Instead of doing something like this:

```swift
func doSomethingIfNeeded() {
	if needed {
		doTheThing()
	}
}
```

Do this:

```swift
func doSomethingIfNeeded() {
	guard needed else { return }
	
	doTheThing()
}
```

Use `defer` if you must validate multiple things and do some cleanup or execute a callback before returning:

```swift
func doSomethingIfNeeded(mustCallThis: (result: String) -> ()) {
	var result = "noresult"
	
	defer {
		mustCallThis(result)
	}
	
	guard needed else { return }
	guard starsAreAligned else { return }
	
	doTheThing()
	result = computeResult()
}
```

####V. Avoid magic numbers and magic strings

If you need to reference specific numbers or strings, encapsulate them in `struct`s or `enum`s.

Here's an example, for some constants:

```swift
class MyCoolController {

	private struct Constants {
		static let name = "John Doe"
		static let specialNumber = 42
	}
	
	func doTheThingy() {
		return Constants.name + "'s number is " + Constants.specialNumber
	}
	
}
```

Here is another example, this time showing how to validate menu items without linking them directly with `IBOutlet` or using `title` and `action` to check which item is being validated:

```swift
class ImagesViewController: NSViewController {
	
	var collectionView: NSCollectionView
	
	// ...
	
	private enum MenuItemTags: Int {
		case ExportAllImages = 1001
		case ExportSelectedImages = 1002
	}
	
	override func validateMenuItem(menuItem: NSMenuItem) -> Bool {
		guard let itemValue = MenuItemTags(rawValue: menuItem.tag) else {
			return false
		}
		
		switch itemValue {
			case .ExportAllImages:
				return images.count > 0
			case .ExportSelectedImages:
				return collectionView.selectionIndexes.count > 0
		}
	}
	
}
```

####VI. Test your code thoroughly and follow linting rules

When you think you're done with your contribution, try to break your code in as many different ways as possible to make sure your implementation is solid:

- If you change something related to the handling of user or application data (model layer) make sure to test the migration of data from a previous version of the app to your modified version.
- If you change a component related to networking, use the network link conditioner and test with a slow/bad connection to see how the app behaves
- If you change something related to UI, try resizing the window and looking at different content to make sure it can adapt well to different environments.


Make sure your code is not introducing any new warnings, including those produced by Swiftlint.

####VII. Dependencies

Do not add dependencies to the project.

Do not bring in assets (icons, images) for which you don't have an appropriate license. Icons and images must have a Creative Commons or similar license to be used in this project. A good place to find free icons is [Icon Finder](https://iconfinder.com).

##3. Conclusion

These are just some suggestions for common scenarios, if you need help with your contribution you can always open an issue to discuss it before doing the pull request.

Have fun ðŸŽ‰
